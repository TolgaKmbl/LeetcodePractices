Create table If Not Exists Employee (id int, salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('3', '300')

  Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.


Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.



Example 1:

Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

/*SELECT
   CASE
       WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT salary) <= 1 THEN NULL
       ELSE (SELECT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC OFFSET 1 ROWS FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY)
   END AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee;*/

SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
